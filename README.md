# 3 Layer Architecture ASP.NET Application


## Frameworks and Libraries
- [ASP.NET Core 2.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.2);
- [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) (mediator pattern implementation for .NET);
- [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) (for data access);
- [Entity Framework In-Memory Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/testing/in-memory) (for testing purposes);

## How to Test

First Add you Connection stirng for the database connection `PlStudent/appsettings.json`

```
 "ConnectionStrings": {
   "DefaultConnection": "ADD YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE"
 }
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/Student/index.html` to check the API documentation and test all endpoints.

## Limitations

The API does not show how to implement distinct databases to read and write data, nor shows advanced synchronization features. The application just shows examples of using MeadiatR and, consequently, the mediator pattern to handle request and responses in a CQRS approach.
